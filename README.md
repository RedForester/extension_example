### RedForester extension example

This extension is written in Python, it uses [rf_client](https://github.com/RedForester/python_rf_client) to simplify the code and Tornado as an asynchronous web server.
But it could be written in any language, using any web server.


`main.py` - core of the 'hello world' extension.  
`register_extension.py` - script to register extension.  
`config.py` - extension and extension-service configuration.
